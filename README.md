# SkyPrism-UL
This code calculates the upper limits of the flux of gamma-rays detected from the MAGIC telescopes using the Rolke method. It's part of my bachelor thesis

This code needs the SkyPrism software and the On, Hadron and Exposure maps it produces. This code should be used after the Position Scan step and replaces the UL sky maps and Values steps.
